# Ember Animated Tutorial - Octane

This is the code companion to my [Animation and Predictable Data Loading in Ember](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/), presented at the Ember ATX Meetup on 3/28/2019.

I updated the Ember project to use Octane features and removed `api` directory for simplicity.

## How to Run

You can run the app as is. Ember Mirage will create random data each time.

1. Do `npm install`.

2. Run `ember s`, then visit `localhost:4200`.

## Octane v. Pre-Octane

You can find the [pre-Octane app on GitHub](https://github.com/ijlee2/ember-animated-tutorial). To learn more about the differences, please see my [blog post](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/12/23/rewriting-apps-in-ember-octane/).
